# CircuitProofs Development Roadmap

**Target:** [Martian Interpretability Challenge](https://withmartian.com/prize) ($1M prize pool)

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20

**Focus:** Formal verification of extracted circuits against ground-truth specifications

---

## Executive Summary

We are pivoting from a "General ML Verification Tool" to a **"Mechanistic Interpretability Microscope for Code LLMs"**. The winning angle: prove extracted circuits match formal specifications—not correlation, but mathematical certainty.

### Why This Wins

Martian criticizes current interpretability for being:
- **Not mechanistic** (correlation, not causation) → We provide Lean proofs
- **Not useful** (no real engineering tools) → We provide verification certificates
- **Incomplete** (narrow wins that don't generalize) → We test across multiple models
- **Doesn't scale** (enormous human effort) → We automate circuit extraction + verification

---

## Current State

### Overall Progress

| Metric | Current | Target | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Critical Path Complete | 0% | 100% | Blocked by stubs and sorry |
| Lean Proofs Complete | 40% | 100% | 16 theorems have `sorry` |
| MBPP Benchmark | 10% | 100% | Scaffolding only |
| Test Pass Rate | 50% | 85% | Vision models failing (deprioritized) |

### Component Status

| Component | Status | Blocker |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **A: Circuit Extraction** | ⚠️ 70% | `_evaluate_circuit()` is stub |
| **B: Circuit → Lean** | ✅ 85% | Minor issues |
| **C: Lean Proofs** | ❌ 40% | 16 `sorry` placeholders |
| **MBPP Benchmark** | ❌ 10% | Not implemented |
| **Distributed Infra** | ⚠️ 60% | Needs adaptation for extraction |

---

## Critical Blockers (Must Fix First)

### 1. `_evaluate_circuit()` Stub

**Location:** `extraction/circuit_extractor.py:340-353`

**Current State:**
```python
def _evaluate_circuit(self, circuit_components, inputs):
    # Simplified: return original model output
    # A full implementation would build a sparse model
    return self.model(inputs)  # ← THIS IS WRONG
```

**Problem:** Returns original model output instead of sparse circuit output. Error bounds are meaningless without this.

**Required Fix:** Build and evaluate a masked/sparse network using the circuit components.

**Expert Needed:** MI/PyTorch engineer (2-3 days)

### 2. Lipschitz Bound Tightness

**Risk:** Error bounds can explode through layer composition, making proofs vacuous.

**Validation Required:**
```python
# Before proceeding to Lean proofs
ratio = theoretical_bound / empirical_max_error
if ratio > 100:
    raise Error("Bounds too loose - fix extraction first")
```

**Gate:** Ratio must be < 100x before proceeding to Phase 2.

### 3. Core Lean Theorems

**`property_transfer`** - `lean/FormalVerifML/base/circuit_models.lean:217`
- Proves properties verified on circuits transfer to original model
- This is the core value proposition

**`lipschitz_composition_bound`** - `lean/FormalVerifML/base/circuit_models.lean:203`
- Justifies the error bound computation

**Expert Needed:** Lean expert (2 weeks total)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Path (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Unblock the core pipeline. Everything else depends on this.

| Task | Owner | Effort | Gate |
|------|-------|--------|------|
| Fix `_evaluate_circuit()` stub | MI engineer | 2-3 days | Sparse model evaluates correctly |
| Run Lipschitz tightness validation | MI engineer | 1-2 days | **Ratio < 100x** |
| Complete `lipschitz_composition_bound` | Lean expert | 1 week | Compiles without sorry |
| Complete `property_transfer` theorem | Lean expert | 1 week | Compiles without sorry |

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] `_evaluate_circuit()` returns actual sparse circuit output
- [ ] Tightness ratio < 100x on DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B test
- [ ] Core Lean theorems compile without `sorry`
- [ ] `lake build` passes

**Go/No-Go Decision (End of Week 1):**

Run tightness validation on DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B solving 3 MBPP problems.

| Result | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| Ratio < 10x | **GO** - proceed to Lean proofs |
| Ratio 10-100x | **CONDITIONAL** - investigate, may need tighter pruning |
| Ratio > 100x | **NO-GO** - fundamental issue, reassess approach |

### Phase 2: MBPP Benchmark Integration (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal:** Complete the ground-truth verification pipeline.

| Task | Owner | Effort | Depends On |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| Implement `fetch_dataset.py` | Python eng | 1 day | — |

| Implement `circuit_comparator.py` | Python eng | 2 days | run_benchmark |
| Test on DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B | ML eng | 3-4 days | All above |

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Can fetch and parse MBPP-Lean dataset
- [ ] Can run extraction + verification on 10 MBPP problems
- [ ] ≥5/10 circuit proofs complete on DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B
- [ ] Counterfactual testing works (variable rename → same circuit)

### Phase 3: Scale & Generalize (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal:** Demonstrate the approach scales and generalizes.

| Task | Owner | Effort | Depends On |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| Adapt distributed infra for extraction | Infra eng | 3-4 days | — |
| Run on StarCoder-7B | ML eng | 3-4 days | Phase 2 |

| Run on CodeLlama-70B | ML eng | 1 week | Distributed infra |
| Cross-model circuit comparison | ML eng | 2-3 days | Multiple model runs |

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Successful extraction from 4 models (1.3B → 70B)
- [ ] Cross-model comparison shows similar circuits for same algorithms
- [ ] No OOM errors on 70B model

### Phase 4: Submission (Weeks 7-8)

**Goal:** Prepare compelling Martian challenge submission.

| Task | Owner | Effort |
|------|-------|--------|
| Analyze results, identify patterns | All | 3-4 days |
| Write technical report | Lead | 3-4 days |
| Create visualizations | ML eng | 2 days |
| Prepare code release | All | 2 days |
