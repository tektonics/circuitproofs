Define equalized odds for a classifier `f` over a population.
Here, we assume that if an individual's ground truth label is 1 (positive),
then the classifier must also output 1—regardless of protected status.
This strong notion of fairness is actionable and can be checked empirically.

We assume the following axioms for our finite population:
- `Individual` is an arbitrary type.
- `protected_group` is a predicate on individuals.
- `groundTruth` gives the true label of an individual.

Define a logistic regression classifier.
Given an individual's features (extracted by `toFeatures`) and a logistic regression model `lm`,
the classifier outputs 1 if the model's evaluation is nonnegative, and 0 otherwise.

  let features := toFeatures ind
  let z := evalLinearModel lm features

Theorem (Extended Fairness):
If for every individual with ground truth 1 the classifier outputs 1,
then the classifier satisfies equalized odds.

We assume as hypothesis `h` that for all individuals with `groundTruth = 1`,
the classifier returns 1. Under that assumption, the fairness condition holds.
